## YTLooper

YTLooper allows you to loop over seleted sections of a YouTube video.  I have been learnin to play Bass guitar and often use YouTube play along videos to learn new songs. When I get stuck on a section I had the need to repeat just that section. I found [AB Loop Player](https://agrahn.gitlab.io/ABLoopPlayer/) but wanted an updated UI and some new features so I decided to write my own, hence YTLooper was conceived.
